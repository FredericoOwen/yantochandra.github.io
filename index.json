While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the ‘‘black box’’nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol.

This phenomenon, resulting from the balance between solid-liquid and liquid-liquid interactions, could benefit the development of microporous membranes for separating water-alcohol mixtures.We used molecular dynamics simulations of water-ethanol mixtures near planar organosilica surfaces, focussing on the role of surface properties in interfacial ethanol enrichment. Surface hydrophobicity was controlled by adjusting the ratio of methyl to hydroxyl groups. We analyzed the impact of surface composition, roughness, and the spatial distribution of functional groups on ethanol adsorption.Our simulations reveal that ethanol preferentially adsorbs onto hydrophobic organosilica surfaces functionalized with methyl groups, similar to previous findings for graphite. Ethanol enrichment is strongly influenced by mixture composition and surface properties, including roughness and functional group distribution. Hydrophobic surfaces consistently exhibit enhanced ethanol affinity, whereas hydroxylated surfaces show weaker adsorption.These findings demonstrate the ability of organosilica materials to preferentially adsorb ethanol over water.

In this paper, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and continuum boundary integral simulations to demonstrate that the time-averaged ‘S’ shape adopted by a flexible graphene nanosheet subject to moderate thermal fluctuation is almost identical to the shape predicted for negligible thermal fluctuations. The stable ‘S’ shape adopted by the particle results primarily from the normal hydrodynamic traction, which is sensitive to the orientation of the particle with respect to the flow direction.

Here, we investigate the effects of minor water content on two representative SPEs through molecular dynamics simulations. Focusing on SPEs composed of different base polymers, namely, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and the same salt, lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), our simulations reveal that slight hydration facilitates an increase in ionic conductivity while preserving the mechanical integrity of the SPEs.

Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces.

However, the interpretation of transport through low aspect-ratio nanopores becomes particularly complex as 3D access effects outside the pores are expected to play a dominant role. Here, we report both experiments and theory showing that, in contrast to naïve expectations, long-range mutual interaction across an array of nanopores leads to a non-extensive, sub-linear scaling of the global conductance on the number of pores N. A scaling analysis demonstrates that the N-dependence of the conductance depends on the topology of the network. It scales like G∼ N/log N for a 1D line of pores, and like| | G∼ N for a 2D array, in agreement with experimental measurements.

While osmosis can be expressed in simple terms via the van ’t Hoff ideal gas formula for the osmotic pressure, it is a complex phenomenon taking its roots in the subtle interactions occurring at the scale of the membrane nanopores. Here we use new opportunities offered by nanofluidic systems to create an osmotic diode exhibiting asymmetric water flow under reversal of osmotic driving. We show that a surface charge asymmetry built on a nanochannel surface leads to nonlinear couplings between water flow and the ion dynamics, which are capable of water flow rectification. This phenomenon opens new opportunities for water purification and complex flow control in nanochannels.","tags":null,"title":"Nanofluidic osmotic diodes: Theory and molecular dynamics simulations","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Laurent Joly","François Detcheverry","Christophe Ybert","Cécile Cottin-Bizonne","Lydéric Bocquet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"15efbfa71f952a81d2bfe6bedf7f21a3","permalink":"https://fredericoowen.github.io/publications/2013_110_41_gravelle_proceedings_of_the_national_academy_of_sciences_optimizing_water_permeability.html","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2013_110_41_gravelle_proceedings_of_the_national_academy_of_sciences_optimizing_water_permeability.html","section":"publications","summary":"The ubiquitous aquaporin channels are able to conduct water across cell membranes, combining the seemingly antagonist functions of a very high selectivity with a remarkable permeability. Whereas molecular details are obvious keys to perform these tasks, the overall efficiency of transport in such nanopores is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation arising at the connection between the nanoconstriction and the nearby bulk reservoirs. In this contribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically examine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from a geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of finite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the overall channel permeability. Moreover, the optimal opening angles that …","tags":null,"title":"Optimizing water permeability through the hourglass shape of aquaporins","type":"publications"}]
