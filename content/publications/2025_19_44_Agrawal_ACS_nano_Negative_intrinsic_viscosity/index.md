abstract: "The viscosity of nanoparticle suspensions is always expected to increase with particle concentration. However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions of atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation. Some experiments indicate effective suspension viscosities below that of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e., the intrinsic viscosity is negative. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high Péclet numbers (Pe ≥ 100), for aspect ratios from 4.5 to 12.0. These simulations robustly confirm that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing aspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold ≈5.5, providing a molecular-level confirmation of this behavior in a realistic graphene–water system. Comparison with continuum boundary integral modeling shows quantitative …"
