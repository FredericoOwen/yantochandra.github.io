Transport of water molecules in a microporous polymer

Molecular dynamics simulation showing water molecules (in red and white) adsorbed within a polymer with molecular-sized pores (in gray). These simulations are used to study the collective transport properties of the molecules, and the results can be compared with those obtained from neutron scattering experiments
