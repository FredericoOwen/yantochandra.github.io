### About me ##

Yanto Chandra is a Full Professor at the City University of Hong Kong's Department of Public and International Affairs, where he co-directs the Technology, Policy, and Law Lab. He is also a member of the Laboratory for Public Management and Policy.

Chandra's research focuses on innovation and strategy in creating value and enhancing performance across the public and social sectors. This includes public sector innovation, digital government, citizen innovation, and new public algorithms (NPA). His projects in recent years examine citizens perceptions toward automation, particularly autonomous AI systems and blockchain, and what it means for better governance theory and practice. His work often applies computational social sciences, experiments (lab, online, field) and other computational methods.

His research has been published in leading public administration and policy journals such as Public Administration Review, Public Management Review, Public Administration, International Public Management Journal, Government Information Quarterly, Journal of Social Policy, and World Development. His research also appears in leading management journals, including the Financial Times (FT) 50 / UTD journals such as the Academy of Management Review, Journal of Management Studies, Journal of International Business Studies, Journal of Business Venturing, and Journal of Business Ethics. He was also one of the first scholars to publish comics (here too) that brought across the principles of management and economics of sustainability.

His research has been supported by the Hong Kong General Research Grants Council, Chiang-Ching Kuo International Research Grants, Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SIEFUND) research grant, among others.

He is a Winner of The Jenei Award Public Management Review 2025 and The Kooiman Best Paper Award 2021, both recognizing his contribution to public management research.

He was ranked in the Top 2% of all scholars in two categories: political science and public adminsitration as well as business and economics according to an author-citation study by Stanford University for the years 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021. He was ranked as one of the Top 3 scholars in Political Science and Public Administration in China in the 2025 and 2024 citation count and ranked in the Top 5 in 2023.

He is an editorial board member of the Public Administration and Development, International Journal of Public Sector Management, and the Academy of Management Perspectives. He serves as an Area Editor of Data & Policy (Cambridge University Press) and Associate Editor for the Journal of Business Venturing Insights. He speaks regularly in various local, regional, and international forums, including Asia, Europe, and the United States, and was invited speakers in major AI x policy forums in Nanyang Technological University, Fudan University, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and has given commentaries in the media, including South China Morning Post, Forkast News, and The Jakarta Post. 

Before rejoining CityU in 2022, he held tenured appointments as Associate Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the City University of Hong Kong (joint appointment between the Department of Public Policy and Department of Management) well as Assistant Professor at the University of Leeds (UK) and University of Amsterdam (NL) business schools.

Chandra completed his PhD and Master of Commerce at the Faculty of Economics and Commerce at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. Prior to and in between his academic life, he spent more than seven years in the corporate ladder, including in decision analytics at HSBC Hong Kong and auditing in Ernst & Young (Jakarta).
